## Getting Started
Hello, today I would like to introduce you to the note application I have created. I completed this application by creating a structure similar to sticky notes.
You can check my Medium account for the details and development stages of the project, which I will add shortly. In the future, I am thinking of creating a notification section for your daily routine tasks.
