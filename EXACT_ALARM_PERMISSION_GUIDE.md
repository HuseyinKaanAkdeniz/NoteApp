# Exact Alarm Permission Guide

## Problem: "exact_alarms_not_permitted" Error

**Error Message**: `PlatformException(exact_alarms_not_permitted, Exact alarms are not permitted, null, null)`

**Cause**: On Android 12+ (API level 31+), exact alarm scheduling requires special permission that users must manually grant.

## ✅ **What I Fixed:**

1. **Added Fallback System**: The app now tries exact scheduling first, then falls back to inexact scheduling if exact alarms are not permitted.

2. **Smart Error Handling**: Added comprehensive error handling to gracefully handle permission issues.

3. **Better Logging**: Added detailed logging to track scheduling attempts and failures.

## 🔧 **How to Fix the Permission Issue:**

### **Option 1: Grant Exact Alarm Permission (Recommended)**

**For Android 12+ devices:**

1. **Go to Settings** on your device
2. **Find your app** (NoteApp) in the app list
3. **Tap on your app**
4. **Look for "Alarms & reminders"** or **"Exact alarms"**
5. **Toggle it ON**

**Alternative path:**
- Settings → Apps → NoteApp → Permissions → Alarms & reminders → Allow

### **Option 2: Use the Debug Page**

The app now has a debug page that will automatically handle the fallback:

1. **Open the app**
2. **Tap the 🐛 (bug) icon** in the top-right corner
3. **Try scheduling a test notification**
4. **The app will automatically use fallback if exact alarms fail**

### **Option 3: Manual Settings (Device-Specific)**

**Samsung:**
- Settings → Apps → NoteApp → Permissions → Alarms & reminders

**Google Pixel:**
- Settings → Apps → NoteApp → Permissions → Alarms & reminders

**OnePlus:**
- Settings → Apps → NoteApp → Permissions → Alarms & reminders

**Xiaomi:**
- Settings → Apps → NoteApp → Permissions → Alarms & reminders

## 📱 **What the Fallback System Does:**

1. **First Attempt**: Tries to schedule with `AndroidScheduleMode.exactAllowWhileIdle`
2. **If Failed**: Automatically falls back to `AndroidScheduleMode.inexact`
3. **Logs Both Attempts**: You can see in the console which method worked

## 🔍 **Check Your Device's Android Version:**

1. **Go to Settings → About phone → Android version**
2. **If it's Android 12 or higher**, you need to grant exact alarm permission
3. **If it's Android 11 or lower**, this shouldn't be an issue

## 🧪 **Testing the Fix:**

### **Test 1: Immediate Notification**
```bash
# This should always work
flutter run
# Go to debug page → "Send Test Notification Now"
```

### **Test 2: Scheduled Notification**
```bash
# This will use fallback if exact alarms fail
flutter run
# Go to debug page → "Schedule Test (1 min from now)"
```

### **Test 3: Check Console Logs**
Look for these messages in the console:
```
Attempting exact scheduling for: [timestamp]
Exact scheduling successful
```
OR
```
Exact scheduling failed: PlatformException(exact_alarms_not_permitted...)
Attempting inexact scheduling as fallback
Inexact scheduling successful (fallback)
```

## 📋 **Device-Specific Solutions:**

| Device Brand | Settings Path |
|--------------|---------------|
| **Samsung** | Settings → Apps → NoteApp → Permissions → Alarms & reminders |
| **Google Pixel** | Settings → Apps → NoteApp → Permissions → Alarms & reminders |
| **OnePlus** | Settings → Apps → NoteApp → Permissions → Alarms & reminders |
| **Xiaomi** | Settings → Apps → NoteApp → Permissions → Alarms & reminders |
| **Huawei** | Settings → Apps → NoteApp → Permissions → Alarms & reminders |

## 🚨 **Important Notes:**

1. **Inexact Scheduling**: If exact alarms fail, the app uses inexact scheduling, which means:
   - Notifications may be delayed by a few minutes
   - The system may batch notifications to save battery
   - Still works reliably for most use cases

2. **Battery Optimization**: Even with inexact scheduling, ensure:
   - Battery optimization is set to "Don't optimize" for your app
   - Background activity is allowed

3. **Notification Channels**: The app creates proper notification channels for both exact and inexact scheduling

## 🔧 **Manual Permission Check:**

You can check if exact alarms are permitted by adding this code temporarily:

```dart
Future<void> checkExactAlarmPermission() async {
  final androidPlugin = flutterLocalNotificationsPlugin
      .resolvePlatformSpecificImplementation<AndroidFlutterLocalNotificationsPlugin>();
  
  if (androidPlugin != null) {
    final canScheduleExactAlarms = await androidPlugin.canScheduleExactAlarms();
    print('Can schedule exact alarms: $canScheduleExactAlarms');
  }
}
```

## 📞 **If Still Having Issues:**

1. **Check Android version** - Only Android 12+ has this restriction
2. **Grant exact alarm permission** in device settings
3. **Use the debug page** to test with fallback
4. **Check console logs** for detailed error messages
5. **Try on a different device** to isolate the issue

## 🎯 **Expected Behavior After Fix:**

- **With Permission**: Notifications fire exactly on time
- **Without Permission**: Notifications fire within a few minutes of the scheduled time
- **Both Cases**: Notifications will work reliably
